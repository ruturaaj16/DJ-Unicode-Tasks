# DJ-Unicode-Tasks
This is my repository for the DJ Unicode backend django tasks.
I have used Python 3.8.4 and Django 3.1 for the tasks. 
For the first task, I shall directly call the function within the file of the code as the function requires two numbers to be taken as input. 
Here's a screenshot of the output: ![Task 1](/Screenshots/Task1.png)
For the second task, I used the dynamic url method to input the parameters for the function.
Here's a screenshot of the output: ![Task 2](/Screenshots/Task2.png)
The third and the fourth tasks involved querying an API and adding the searches to a database. I used the "Exchange Rates API" of teh European Central Bank and the default SQLite Database. 
Here are the screenshots of the output:
