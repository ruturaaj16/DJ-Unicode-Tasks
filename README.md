# DJ-Unicode-Tasks
This is my repository for the DJ Unicode backend django tasks.
I have used Python 3.8.4 and Django 3.1 for the tasks. 
For the first task, I shall directly call the function within the file of the code as the function requires two numbers to be taken as input. 
Here's a screenshot of the output: ![Task 1](/Screenshots/Task1.png)
